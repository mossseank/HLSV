## Generated

This directory contains the parser and lexer base files that are generated by Antlr from the HLSV grammar. All files (except for this README) are ignored, and will never be included in the version control. This is because the grammar files are deterministically generated, so they should be built when they are needed, and not kept around.

In order to build the grammar files, see the `build.bat`/`build.sh` scripts in the grammar folder in the root of the project. Those should be called before compiling the library, and any time that the grammar files (`.g4`) are modified.
