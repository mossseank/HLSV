## Generated

This directory contains the parser and lexer files generated by Antlr for the HLSV grammar. These files are ignored in version control, since they can be quickly generated.

In order to build the grammar files, see the `build.bat`/`build.sh` scripts in the grammar folder in the root of the project.

Antlr requires the Java runtime to be installed to generate the runtime files. For now, this is required for anyone who is compiling HLSV. When the grammar is stable, the generated files will be included, so Java will only be required when modifying the grammar itself.
